This is a capstone project website that utilizes the https://favqs.com api to retrieve GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE information from user input. This site is designed to generate quotes and allow the user to create account and post their own quotes, like quotes from other authors, and manage their account information. Since no database was used to store user information; cookies were used to Persist User Session. Cookies are a simple and common way to store session data on the client side. After a user logs in or signs up, their session token is saved in a cookie and it's used on subsequent requests, and the app session token is stored in an external config file. The focus of this capstone was to make http requests using axios to an external api.
